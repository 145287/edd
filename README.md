# Experiment Data Depot

The Experiment Data Depot (EDD) is a web-based repository of processed biological data obtained
via experimentation.  See the deployed version at [public-edd.jbei.org][1].

## Contents

* [Getting Started](#Getting_Started)
* [Running EDD](#Running_EDD)

For a more detailed reference for EDD's low-level configuration options, see [Configuration][4].
If you're just starting out with EDD, follow directions here first.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Started <a name="#Getting_Started"/>

With [Docker][2] and [Docker Compose][3] installed, launching the entire EDD software stack is as
simple as copying the `docker_services` directory of the code repository and running:

    ./init-config.sh "Your Name" "youremail@example.com"
    docker-compose up -d

Without additional configuration, the launched copy of EDD will be using default options, so some
functions (e.g. TLS support, external authentication, referencing an ICE deployment) won't work.
See [Deployment][5] for more detailed instructions for installing Docker and configuring EDD for
your deployment environment.

## Running EDD <a name="#Running_EDD"/>

This section is a quick reference for commonly helpful commands for running / developing EDD. Many
of them use Docker Compose and other related Docker tools that aren't fully documented here.

* __Docker services__

  `docker-compose` is the recommended tool for controlling EDD services. `docker-compose.yml`
  defines the list of services as top-level entries under the 'services' line.

  For quick reference, at the time of writing the provided services are:
    * edd: runs initial setup tasks and prepares the other services
    * appserver: runs the EDD web application
    * worker: long-running and background tasks are run here with Celery
    * postgres: provides EDD's database
    * redis: provides the cache back-end for EDD
    * solr: provides a search index for EDD
    * rabbitmq: messaging bus that supports Celery
    * flower: management / monitoring application for Celery
    * smtp: mail server that supports emails from EDD
    * nginx: webserver that proxies clients' HTTP requests to other Docker services

  While edd is running, you can also get a list of its services by runnning `docker-compose ps`
  from the main directory. Each container will be listed in the "Name" column of the output, with a
  name generated by Docker Compose. The name consists of three parts separated by underscores:
    * the "project", by default the current directory, may be set using the `-p` flag to 
      `docker-compose` or the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable;
    * the "service" name;
    * a counter value, to distinguish multiple containers scaled beyond the first;
  As an example, the container named `edd_appserver_1` is the first instance of the `appserver`
  service in the `edd` project. You can also use `docker ps` from anywhere on the host to get a
  similar listing, though it will include all containers running on your host, not just those
  defined by EDD.

* __`docker-compose` commands__
   * Build all services:  `docker-compose build`
   * Startup all services in detached mode: `docker-compose up -d` (recommended to keep muliple
     service logs from cluttering the screen, and so `^C` doesn't stop EDD)
   * View logs: `docker-compose logs [service]`
   * Bringing down all services: `docker-compose down`
   * See more in the [Docker Compose documentation][3]

* __Running multiple copies of EDD__

  If running multiple copies of EDD on one host, you _must_ use the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`
  environment variable or add the `-p` flag to every `docker-compose` command. Otherwise, each copy
  will create containers named similar to `dockerservices_edd_1`, because of the name of the
  `docker_services` subdirectory containing the Docker files. Commands intended for other copies
  will execute on the first launched copy, and not work as expected.

* __Determining the local URL for EDD's web interfaces:__

  If using a Linux host or Docker for Mac, use the hostname `localhost`. If using Docker Toolbox or
  docker-machine, use the hostname given by `docker-machine ip default`.
    * __EDD:__ https://localhost/
    * __EDD's REST API:__ https://localhost/rest/ (if enabled)
    * __Solr:__ https://localhost/solr/
    * __Flower:__ https://localhost/flower/
    * __RabbitMQ Management Plugin:__ https://localhost/rabbitmq/

* __Interfacing with EDD's services from the command line:__
   * To run commands in __new__ containers, use `docker-compose run $SERVICE $COMMAND`,
     e.g.: `docker-compose run edd python manage.py shell`. Many Docker tutorals use "run" to
   simplify the directions, but it should generally be avoided since it creates new containers
   unnecessarily.
   * Run commands in __existing__ containers with `docker-compose exec $SERVICE $COMMAND`,
     e.g.: `docker-compose exec appserver python manage.py shell`
   * Restart misbehaving services with:  `docker-compose restart $SERVICE`
   * Other useful sample commands:
       * Connect to the Postgres command line: `docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres`
       * Connect to the Django shell: `docker-compose exec appserver python manage.py shell`

* __Running Docker commands in new shell sessions__
    * The `docker` command will look for a Docker daemon running on the local machine by
      default. Mac hosts currently must use a daemon running in a VirtualBox guest VM. Load
      the Docker environment on the guest with:

          eval "$(docker-machine env default)"

    * Docker will re-use built images, so changes to code may not be reflected in running
      containers. (Re)build the container images with current code using:

          docker-compose build
