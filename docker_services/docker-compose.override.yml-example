# This docker-compose.override.yml file contains local overrides to the Docker Compose
#   configuration of EDD. A copy based on docker-compose.override.yml-example -- containing some
#   example overrides in configuration to use in development environments -- will be created from
#   running the init-config.sh script. Change the values here to alter the settings used when
#   launching with the `docker-compose` commands.

# SECURITY:
# Note that defaults configured in this file MUST keep default EDD installs secure so that clients
#   who install EDD out-of-the-box aren't introducing security risks or exposing services
#   unintentionally.

# To use the docker-compose.yml file without these overrides, launch Docker Compose like this:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml {COMMAND}

# To use the docker-compose.yml file with different overrides, launch Docker Compose like this:
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f different.yml {COMMAND}

# Order matters when specifying overrides! Any scalar values will use the last specified value,
#   while any lists or dictionaries are merged.

version: '2.1'

volumes:

  # Override existing volume definitions by adding an entry with the same name here. The
  #   staticdata definition here adds nothing more to the base configuration.
  staticdata: {}
  # While the solrdata definition here instructs compose to use the volume named my_volume
  #   in place of the default PROJECTNAME_solrdata volume created by Compose. To use
  #   the my_volume volume, you *must* create it yourself using a command like:
  #   `docker volume create --name my_volume`
  #solrdata:
  #  external:
  #    name: my_volume

  # Add new volume definition(s) by creating new name(s).
  #mycustomdata: {}

services:

  # Uncomment a service block to override the settings for that block. Examples below override
  #   settings to expose service ports to all addresses of the Docker host.
  #postgres:
  #  # Make the postgres 5432 port available on the Docker host external network
  #  ports:
  #    - '5432:5432'
  #redis:
  #  # Make the redis 6379 port available on the Docker host external network
  #  ports:
  #    - '6379:6379'
  #solr:
  #  # Make the solr 8983 port available on the Docker host external network
  #  ports:
  #    - '8983:8983'
  #rabbitmq:
  #  # Make the rabbitmq management 15672 port available on the Docker host external network
  #  ports:
  #    - '15672:15672'
  #flower:
  #  # Make the flower 5555 port available on the Docker host external network
  #  ports:
  #    - '5555:5555'

  # Override settings for EDD container(s).
  edd:

    # Examples of overriding the default initialize command below.
    # To initialize EDD without attempting to run database migrations:
    #command: [-M, application]
    # To initialize EDD without attempting to load a database or re-index:
    #command: [-DI, application]
    # To initialize EDD but wait for a newly-defined service foobar to listen on port 1234:
    #command: [--wait-host, foobar, --wait-port, 1234, application]
    # To run all setup tasks, but not launch the EDD application:
    #command: [init-only]
    # [DEVMODE] By default, edd runs with the application command; uncomment below to run with
    #   the devmode command instead, and use Django's ruserver to serve the application.
    #command: [-A, devmode]
    # [LOCAL] For more control over settings on each container, use the --local flag to pass a
    #   path to a local.py file to use. The path must be mounted in the volumes section! Take care
    #   to use only one volumes section, if multiples are specified in a service, only the last
    #   specified is used.
    #command: [-A, --local, /etc/myorg/edd/local.py, -w, edd, application]
    #volumes:
    #  - /full/path/to/local.py:/etc/myorg/edd/local.py

    # Override the default environment
    environment:
      # The following is not strictly necessary, just here so there is not an empty dictionary
      EDD_CONTAINER: "edd"

      # Set the deployment environment flag. Supported values are:
      #   * DEVELOPMENT,
      #   * INTEGRATION,
      #   * PRODUCTION,
      #   * TEST,
      #   * or, any of those strings followed by an arbitrary suffix.
      # Values other than PRODUCTION will create obvious labeling differences in the UI to make
      #   them easy to distinguish, and to help prevent accidental data changes in production
      #   during the testing process.
      #EDD_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT: "TEST"

      # The below options will set the default administrative user when using the stock local
      #   settings file. The values will be replaced in this example after running the
      #   init-config.sh script. To set multiple administrative users, or change any other
      #   local settings, see the command in the appserver container definition with [LOCAL].
      #EDD_USER: "Alice Liddell"
      #EDD_EMAIL: "aliddell@example.net"

      #POSTGRES_DUMP_URL: ''
      # Uncomment below lines to copy values from environment on launch, rather than hard-coding
      #POSTGRES_DUMP_FILE: ${POSTGRES_DUMP_FILE}
      #POSTGRES_DUMP_URL: ${POSTGRES_DUMP_URL}

      # Set these variables to control proxy through nginx
      # NOTE: IP addresses not accepted for VIRTUAL_HOST. For local testing, create an entry in
      # /etc/hosts, e.g. 192.168.99.100 local-development, then add the host name you chose to
      # ALLOWED_HOSTS in your local.py
      #VIRTUAL_HOST: edd.example.net
      # If doing local-only testing, no certificates are generated, and nginx will not listen on
      #   port 443; set the HTTPS_METHOD to "noredirect" to access via port 80 without automatic
      #   redirect to 443
      #HTTPS_METHOD: "noredirect"

      #LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL: "aliddell@example.net"
      # The below line directs to use staging Let's Encrypt server. It is commented out by
      #   default, but should be enabled while troubleshooting any errors getting a certificate.
      #   Troubleshooting against the production Let's Encrypt server is likely to hit rate
      #   limits; see <https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/>.

    # The following ports definition publishes (reading backwards) port 8000 of the container

    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:8000:8000'

    # The default mode is also to run with Python code contained within the edd-core image. To run
    #   with a local copy of code and do, e.g. live code reload, uncomment and edit the volume
    #   below. The first part is your local filesystem path, and /code is the location where the
    #   container will expect externally-loaded code. This setting will ONLY apply to the container
    #   where it is defined; overrides occur after the extends in the base file. If mounting code
    #   in the edd service, one should also mount code in the appserver and worker services.
    #volumes:

  worker:

    # Override the default environment to direct errors to the guilty.
    environment:

  nginx:

    # Uncomment the below volume to mount a folder containing TLS certificates/keys for copying.
    #   The container expects the following files:
    #     * certificate.key = the private key for the certificate
    #     * certificate.chained.crt = the certificate for the domain + intermediate certificates
    #     * trustchain.crt = the intermediate certificates in the trust chain to the CA
    #     * dhparam.pem = PEM-format file containing parameters to use in Diffie-Hellman exchange
    #   The final :ro specifier ensures that the path is mounted read-only.
