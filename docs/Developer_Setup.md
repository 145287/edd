---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mac OS Setup <a name="MacOS_Setup"/>

This section contains directions for setting up a development environment for EDD on Mac OS.

* XCode <a name="XCode"/>
    * Install XCode (and associated Developer Tools) via the App Store
    * As of OS X 10.9 "Mavericks": `xcode-select --install` to just get command-line tools
* Homebrew <a name="HomeBrew"/>
    * [Homebrew][1] is a package manager for OS X. The Homebrew packages handle installation and
      dependency management for Terminal software. The Caskroom extension to Homebrew does the
      same for GUI applications.
    * To install:
      `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
      and follow prompts.
        - NOTE: This is automatically run as part of the `start-edd.sh` script.
    * `brew doctor` should say `Your system is ready to brew.` or describe any problems.
    * From the edd root directory, `brew bundle` should install additional software dependencies.
    * It is a good idea to occaisionally run `brew update` to refresh Homebrew's list of available
      packages and versions; and run `brew upgrade` to install updated versions of your installed
      Homebrew packages.
* Docker <a name="Docker"/>
    * [Docker][2] is a container virtualization platform: all software, configuration, and
      dependencies required to run a service are packaged into standalone images. These images are
      ready to run immediately upon being copied to a new host running a Docker daemon.
    * Docker will be installed already via Homebrew in the previous step.
    * Running Docker images
        * Verify Docker is configured by running: `docker run --rm hello-world`
            * Get `docker: command not found`? You didn't successfully install from Homebrew.
    * Try the command `docker-compose`
        * If you get `Illegal instruction: 4`, you have an older Mac that cannot run with the
          compiled binary provided by the Homebrew packages; run `pip install docker-compose` to
          fix the error.
        * Normal output is helptext showing the commands to use with `docker-compose`.
    * Resources available for Docker containers are set in the Docker menu Preferences, under the
      Advanced tab. It is recommended to allocate at least 2 CPU cores and 2 GB RAM to Docker.
      Click the `Apply & Restart` button to restart Docker with updated resource allocations.
* Complete "Common Setup Tasks" below to get EDD configured and running for the first time
* Complete the "For Developers" section below for a few additional development configurations


### Linux / Debian Setup<a name="Debian"/>

This section contains directions for setting up a production deployment for EDD on Debian.

* Follow the Docker-recommended instructions for [installing the daemon for your distro][5].
    * There is a `docker` package in the Debian apt repos. It isn't [Docker][2]!
    * There is a `docker.io` package too; this can work, but it will generally be outdated.
* Test by running `docker run --rm hello-world` and `docker-compose`
* Complete "Common Setup Tasks" below now that Docker is in place


### Common Setup Tasks
After you have all of the Docker tools minimally configured for your environment, perform the
following steps to configure EDD and launch it for the first time.

* __Clone the repo__: `git clone https://github.com/JBEI/edd.git`

* __Install virtualenvwrapper__
    * `pip install virtualenvwrapper`
    * Create a folder for your virtualenvs; recommend `~/.virtualenvs` or `/usr/local/virtualenvs`
    * Add lines to your `.bashrc`:

          export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
          source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

    * Activate changes with `source ~/.bashrc`

* __From `./docker_services/` run `. init-config --project edd`__
  This script will:
    * Test your git configuration
    * Copy sample configuration files
    * Generate random passwords for use in autoconfiguring EDD's Docker services
    * Create a virtualenv named `edd`

* __Configure `secrets.env`__
  The `init-config` script will create a `secrets.env` file, containing random generated passwords
  and connection URLs for services. These passwords are set in the service data volumes on first
  launch; to use alternate passwords or existing services (e.g. if you already have a Postgres
  cluster), edit the file prior to launching EDD.

* (_optional_) __Build or Pull EDD's images__
  The start script will automatically ensure that Docker images are present on the host before
  launching; however, it is sometimes useful to run this step manually to have more control over
  the images used to launch containers.
    * Build images from the repository Dockerfiles with `docker-compose build`
    * Pull pre-built images from Docker Hub with `docker-compose pull`
    * Tag images with version tags using the `docker tag {src-image} {tag-name}` command

* __Launch EDD's services__
  Run `./start-edd.sh`. At this point, you can use Docker commands to view the logs for
  each service or to locate the IP for viewing EDD's web interface.

  See "Running EDD" below for a list of helpful commands. If you skipped the previous step, this
  command will take significantly longer the first time you run it, since Docker has to initially
  build / configure the EDD services before they can run.

* __Install and configure a supporting [ICE][7] deployment__
  EDD requires ICE as a reference for strains used in EDD's experiments. You will not be able to
  reference strains in your EDD studies until EDD can successfully communicate and authenticate
  with ICE.
    * Follow ICE's directions for installation/setup
    * Create a base-64 encoded HMAC key to for signing communication from EDD to ICE. EDD's default
      configuration assumes a key ID of 'edd', but you can change it by overriding the value of
      `ICE_KEY_ID` in your `local.py`. For example, to generate a random 64-byte/512-bit key:

          openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n' > hmac.key

    * Configure ICE with the HMAC key. In the `rest-auth` folder of the linked ICE deployment, copy
      the `hmac.key` file above to a file named with `ICE_KEY_ID`; 'edd' by default.
    * Configure EDD with the HMAC key. Edit `secrets.env` to set the value of `ICE_HMAC_KEY` to the
      value inside `hmac.key`. Do a `docker-compose restart` if you already had Docker running.
    * See directions under Common 'Maintenance/Development Tasks' to test EDD/ICE communication


### For Developers:

There is configuration already in place to help you work on EDD. Uncomment support for the
[Django debug toolbar][10] in the sample `local.py` file to run EDD with a helpful debug
application. This will add an expandable toolbar to every page, showing information like request
headers, SQL queries run, template context, signals fired, etc.

The EDD makes use of Node.js packages for managing front-end code. All dev dependencies are
contained in the Dockerfile in the `node` directory, available under the tag `jbei/edd-node` on
Docker Hub. This image has `node` and `npm` installed, with all the packages necessary to build
EDD. It is used as part of the build of the `jbei/edd-core` image, to prepare front-end assets.
EDD uses [TypeScript][4] for its client-side interface, and compiles JavaScript with third-party
libraries using [Webpack][9].

Running a full Docker build, for only some changes to the TypeScript code, will be inefficient. As
a shortcut, you can instead launch a new container using the `jbei/edd-node` image, and use the
`--volumes-from` flag to load in volumes from a `jbei/edd-core` EDD container. The container
launched with `jbei/edd-node` can then compile TypeScript code, and copy the finished bundle code
to the `jbei/edd-core` container.

          docker run --rm -it --volumes-from "$(docker-compose ps -q edd | head -1)" \
            jbei/edd-node:latest /bin/bash


#### Helpful Python Packages <a name="Helpful_Python"/>

* django-debug-toolbar `pip install django-debug-toolbar`
    * Include `debug_toolbar` in `./edd/settings/local.py` INSTALLED_APPS

## Running EDD <a name="#Running_EDD"/>

This section is a quick reference for commonly helpful commands for running / developing EDD. Many
of them use Docker Compose and other related Docker tools that aren't fully documented here.

* __Docker services__

  `docker-compose` is the recommended tool for controlling EDD services. `docker-compose.yml`
  defines the list of services as top-level entries under the 'services' line.

  For quick reference, the provided services are:
    * __init__: runs initial startup tasks and prepares the other services
    * __edd__: WSGI server that runs the EDD webapp
    * __worker__: long-running and background tasks are run here with Celery
    * __postgres__: provides EDD's database
    * __redis__: provides the cache back-end for EDD
    * __solr__: provides a search index for EDD
    * __rabbitmq__: messaging bus that supports Celery
    * __flower__: management / monitoring application for Celery
    * __smtp__: mail server that supports emails from EDD

  These additional services may be included as well:
    * __nginx__: webserver that proxies clients' HTTP requests to other Docker services
    * __nginx-gen__: monitors container start/stop events to generate configs for `nginx`
    * __letsencrypt__: generates TLS certificates for `nginx` through the Let's Encrypt service

  While edd is running, you can also get a list of its services by runnning `docker-compose ps`
  from the `docker_services` directory. Each container will be listed in the "Name" column of the
  output, with a name generated by Docker Compose. The name consists of three parts separated
  by underscores:
    * the "project", by default the current directory, may be set using the `-p` flag to
      `docker-compose` or the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable;
    * the "service" name;
    * a counter value, to distinguish multiple containers scaled beyond the first;
  As an example, the container named `edd_worker_1` is the first instance of the `worker`
  service in the `edd` project. You can also use `docker ps` from anywhere on the host to get a
  similar listing, though it will include all containers running on your host, not just those
  defined by EDD.

* __Starting and Stopping__
    * Recommended to use the `start-edd.sh` and `stop-edd.sh` scripts, rather than directly running
      `docker-compose` commands.

* __`docker-compose` commands__
    * View logs: `docker-compose logs [service]`
    * See more in the [Docker Compose documentation][8]

* __Running multiple copies of EDD__

  If running multiple copies of EDD on one host, you _must_ use the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`
  environment variable or add the `-p` flag to every `docker-compose` command. Otherwise, each copy
  will create containers named similar to `dockerservices_edd_1`, because of the name of the
  `docker_services` subdirectory containing the Docker-related files. Commands intended for other
  copies will execute on the first launched copy, and not work as expected.

* __Determining the local URL for EDD's web interfaces:__

  If using a Linux host or Docker for Mac, use the hostname `edd.lvh.me`.
    * __EDD:__ `http://edd.lvh.me/`
    * __EDD's REST API:__ `http://edd.lvh.me/rest/` (if enabled)
    * __Solr:__ `http://solr.lvh.me/` (if configured in `docker-compose.override.yml`)
    * __Flower:__ `http://flower.lvh.me/` (if configured in `docker-compose.override.yml`)
    * __RabbitMQ Management Plugin:__ `http://rabbitmq.lvh.me/` (if configured in
      `docker-compose.override.yml`)

* __Interfacing with EDD's services from the command line:__
    * Run commands in __existing__ containers with `docker-compose exec $SERVICE $COMMAND`,
      e.g.: `docker-compose exec edd python /code/manage.py shell`
    * Restart misbehaving services with: `docker-compose restart $SERVICE`
