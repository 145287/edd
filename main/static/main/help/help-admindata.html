<DIV style="font-size:0.9em;">

<p>This is the administration section, where system administrators can create and edit data that
    may not be accessible elsewhere in the EDD.
    As you enter your experiment results in the site, you may have to go in here every now and then to add a new Carbon Source, Strain, or metadata type.</p>

<p>Carbon Sources and Strains are special values that are assigned to Lines.  Metadata types can be
    added for Lines, or for Protocols, allowing you to carry along all the incidental non-measurement data that goes with each experiment.</p>

<p>Every now and then you may also need to go in here and add a new Protocol, for some sweet new measurement process you've created to get more valuable data.</p>
