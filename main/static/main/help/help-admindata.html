<p>This is the data types section, where you make alterations and additions to the different data types used throughout the EDD.  As you enter your experiment results in the site, you may have to go in here every now and then to add a new Carbon Source, Strain, or metadata type.</p>

<p>Carbon Sources and Strains are special data types that are assigned to Lines.  Metadata types can be added for Lines, or for Protocols, allowing you to carry along all the incidental non-measurement data that goes with each experiment.</p>

<p>Every now and then you may also need to go in here and add a new Protocol, for some sweet new measurement process you've created to get more valuable data.</p>
