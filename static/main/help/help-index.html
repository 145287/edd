<div style="font-size:0.9em;">

<p>Congratulations!  You have found the click-to-disclose help section for the Experiment Data Depot (EDD) site!</p>

<p>If you're a new user, you might want to start in the <a href="/Documentation/index.html">General Help Section</a> and read all the goodies there.  As you go on to explore the rest of the EDD site, you can find additional help for each page by clicking the same "Help" link that you used to show these instructions.  Any page with a solid triangle next to the "Help" link will disclose customized help for that page.  You can click the link again to hide the content.</p>

<p>The page you are on now is called the Study Selection page, and it's the starting place for new or returning users.  The primary feature of this page is a table of all the Studies you have access to, and some information about each one, such as the last time it was modified.

<!-- The Studies are organized into folders.  You can control which folder gets displayed at the top of the page by selecting a "home folder" on the <a href="/Preferences.cgi">User Preferences</a> page.</P>

<P>If you don't see the folder you're looking for, you should probably speak to an EDD admin to change your access settings.</P>

<P>  -->

From here you can click on a Study to start exploring the data that you or others have placed in the EDD.</p>
