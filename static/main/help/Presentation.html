     "<p>Some of the success of a data storage site is determined by how catchy the acronym is.</p><p>EDD is only a slightly tortured acronym, but the important thing is, you can say it without sounding ridiculous.  \"Is the data in the EDD yet?\"</p><p>Or maybe I'm wrong - it's subjective after all - since \"Hey, did you stick your latest result data into Ed yet\" does sound a bit questionable...</p><p>(Click the arrows on the lower right to proceed.)</p>"],

    ["2.png",
     "<p>The logo for the EDD originally had a drawing of a delivery truck tacked onto it, to emphasize the 'depot' part of Experiment Data Depot, but I decided it was a waste of space and removed it.</p><p>The idea is still valid, though.  The EDD is meant to act as an assembly point for various forms of experiment data, so the assembled collections can be viewed together, and then exported to other tools and data systems here at JBEI.</p><p>Sound good?  Sound like a lot of work, pointing and clicking and organizing?  A distraction from your research perhaps?</p>"],

    ["3.png",
     "<p>A UCSC professor and friend of mine once said, when I confronted him about the incredibly messy state of his home office, \"Well, you can either clean things up, or you can get things done.\"</p><p>At first I was surprised by his attitude, but after working with other academics for a while, I realized that his attitude was quite common.  His research and his teaching kept him busy all the time, and from his point of view, if he carved out time from those activities to clean up his office, he wouldn't derive very much benefit from it.  When he needed something, he could usually remember where it was, regardless of whether that place was in a neatly labeled folder in a drawer, or in a tangled heap in some random corner under a coffee pot.  He had his \"system\".</p><p>His \"system\" had a flaw, though.  If someone else needed data from him (that he hadn't published), he had to go swimming back into the archives looking for it - and since it was something that was no longer relevant to his personal work, he no longer remembered exactly where it had gone.</p><p>Since his system made collaboration very time-consuming for him, he tended to shy away from collaboration.</p><p>The reason I'm telling this story is to explain the design philosophy of the EDD:  It needs to be easy enough to use that it doesn't impact your research time too much, while still making collaboration, and access to historical data, easier.</p>"],

    ["4.png",
     "<p>Philosophy is grand, but what does the EDD do specifically?  Let's jump into the web site.</p><p>When you first open it in your browser, you'll see a login screen like this.</p><p>Use your lbl.gov email address and password to identify yourself.  (If that doesn't work, speak to an admin, for example <A HREF=\"mailto:gwbirkel@lbl.gov\">gwbirkel@lbl.gov</A>.)</p>"],

    ["5.png",
     "<p>The first thing you see upon logging in is the Studies page.  In this example screenshot, there are only 7 Studies in the EDD.</p>"],

    ["6.png",
     "<p>To learn what a Study is, let's click on one.</p>"],

    ["7.png",
     "<p>Usually, at the top of every Study, you will find a box with a few pieces of general information, followed by a box called \"Measurement Data Overview\".  This box gives you a comprehensive look at the data in the Study -- what measurements are present, what measuring times have been used, et cetera.</p><p>You can click on the triangles at the bottom of the box to show various filtering criteria, to get a closer look at things.</p>"],

    ["8.png",
     "<p>You can also hover the mouse over any data point to get an exact value.</p>"],

    ["9.png",
     "<p>For now, let's get that \"Measurement Data Overview\" box out of the way, and look at the section just beneath it, called \"Lines\".</p><p>Each Study consists of a set of Lines.  You can think of a Line as the contents of one container, like a flask or a petri dish, where you are testing some strain grown in some specific set of conditions.</p><p>For example, say you take some strain or modified strain from the Registry, and place it in a set of six containers, and you use one kind of growth media in the first three, and a different kind of growth media in the remaining three.  Since you have six containers, you would track that in the EDD by creating six Lines in your Study.</p><p>The number of Lines you add will vary, of course.  For one Study you may prepare several dozen containers, each with a slight variation - say a different strain, or a different feed, or a different induction - and you'd need several dozen Lines to track them.  In another Study you may only need three containers, and three Lines.</p><p>Lines can vary by other factors besides strain, feed, induction, shaking speed, et cetera.  You can add whatever metadata you think is appropriate, and you don't need to use every kind of metadata for each Study.</p>"],

    ["10.png",
     "<p>Once you have a bunch of Lines set up and growing, of course the next thing you're going to want to do is run Assays against them, according to one or more Protocols.</p><p>That's where the next part of the Study page comes in...</p>"],

    ["11.png",
     "<p>The rest of the Study page is taken up by a box called \"Assays\".  The \"Assays\" box is subdivided into sections, with one Protocol per section.</p>"],

    ["12.png",
     "<p>For example, in the Study we're viewing here, the first section is for the HPLC Protocol.  All the Assays we have performed in this Study using the HPLC Protocol are listed here.</p>"],

    ["13.png",
     "<p>Each Assay we perform gets a label...</p>"],

    ["14.png",
     "<p>...And each Assay is performed against a Line.  In this example we're performing one HPLC Assay on each of the eight Lines in the Study.</p>"],

    ["15.png",
     "<p>The HPLC Protocol can measure the amount of various materials, such as Acetate, Ethanol, Gluconate, Tyrosine, et cetera.  Here we're performing the HPLC Protocol to measure the same three things across all eight of our Lines: 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate, Chorismate, and Tyrosine.</p>"],

    ["16.png",
     "<p>We've taken measurements for each material at seven timestamps...</p>"],

    ["17.png",
     "<p>...And the data for all the measurements in this Protocol is visible on a nearby graph.</p><p>Each Protocol section can be folded out of the way by clicking on the triangle next to the name.  Let's click HPLC out of the way...</p>"],

    ["18.png",
     "<p>...And let's also click the O2/CO2 Protocol out of the way...</p>"],

    ["19.png",
     "<p>...So we can see the Assays for the OD600 Protocol, which measures optical density with 600 nanometer light rays.</p><p>OD600 has only one quantity to measure, called OD here.  Again we have seven data points collected for each Assay, and you can see the data in the graph attached to the section.  You can also see some of the options you get for manipulating the measurement data, in the shaded area at the bottom of the box.</p>"],

    ["20.png",
     "<p>Additional information is revealed for each Assay when you hover over the label, including an edit link.  You can edit Assays one at a time, by clicking each link, or you can edit them in groups, by checking the checkboxes lined up next to the Assays.</p>"],

    ["21.png",
     "<p>To help you select groups of Assays quickly, the EDD has a drag-select feature.  Click on the top item and drag the mouse down, and all the intermediate checkboxes will be marked.</p><p>This feature works everywhere on the site, whenever you see a column of checkboxes.  It saves a LOT of time.</p>"],

    ["22.png",
     "<p>With a bunch of Assays selected, you can take one of the actions at the bottom of the box, such as \"Edit Or Add Measurements\".  Let's click that button and see where it goes...</p>"],

    ["23.png",
     "<p>\"Edit Or Add Measurements\" takes us to the Assay Data page.  This is probably the most complicated, but the most useful, page in the EDD.</p><p>Using this page you can import, and edit, large chunks of raw data.  Think of all those Excel files you have sitting around, with tables pasted into them.  All those text files with comma-separated columns of numbers.  All those long, weird looking instrument dumps, like that horrible thing the RAMOS instrument spits out...  You can deal with many of those on this page.</p><p>The page is broken into steps, and the steps guide you along this sequence:</p><ol><li>Describe the X- and Y-dimensions of your data.</li><li>Dump in the data itself.</li><li>Trim out the bits you don't want.</li><li>Verify that it's being interpreted correctly.</li><li>Supply additional details for each row and/or column.</li><li>Submit the data.</li></ol><p>Steps 1 and 2 are visible in the screenshot here.  Let's take a closer look at Step 2...</p>"],

    ["24.png",
     "<p>Step 2 is pretty simple.  It's a big text input box, with a bunch of numbers in it.  This is actually raw data from the EDD, laid out according to the settings in Step 1.</p><p>It's a two-dimensional data set, with one row per line, and each column separated by a tab.</p><p>You can edit the values right here, in-place, if you want, but the neat thing about this table is...</p>"],

    ["25.png",
     "<p>... You can select it, with the mouse or the select-all keyboard shortcut, and copy it all to the clipboard ...</p>"],

    ["26.png",
     "<p>... And paste it directly into an Excel spreadsheet, and it will appear looking like this.</p><p>The reverse is also true as well.  You can select a table like this one, in any Excel document of your own, and paste it into the text box in Step 2...</p>"],

    ["27.png",
     "<p>... And it will show up as a chunk of tab-separated text, ready for processing.</p><p>You can also paste comma-separated (\"CSV\") data in here, and the EDD will parse it just fine.</p>"],

    ["28.png",
     "<p>Any data you edit in or paste into Step 2 will be automatically processed and appear in Step 3, as a grid with row and column labels drawn from the text.</p>"],

    ["29.png",
     "<p>If you paste in a chunk of data with a column you don't need, you can disable it by checking a box.</p>"],

    ["30.png",
     "<p>... Same with any rows you don't need.</p>"],

    ["31.png",
     "<p>... And you can disable individual values by double-clicking on them.</p><p>Remember to hover over the 'Help' buttons for additional instructions as you're using the page.</p>"],

    ["32.png",
     "<p>Step 4 is at the bottom of the page.  Here is where you hook up the individual rows and columns of your data with measurements in the EDD.</p><p>If you are editing data that's already in the EDD, then these pulldowns will be set for you, matching the raw data in the edit box from Step 2.  If you are importing new data, then the EDD will attempt to set these pulldowns automatically, based on the settings in Step 1 and some guesswork.</p>"],

    ["33.png",
     "<p>If you are importing metadata, such as the standard concentration used across an entire set of measurements, then an additional set of pulldowns appears in Step 4.</p>"],

    ["34.png",
     "<p>This way, you don't have to import one type of metadata at a time; you can import an entire grid.</p>"],

    ["35.png",
     "<p>Here's an example of the kind of data you can copy directly out of an Excel spreadsheet and paste into Step 2.  This is a measurement taken at six different times across eight different Assays.</p>"],

    ["36.png",
     "<p>It doesn't matter whether the Assays are in rows or columns.  Here's an Excel table of a measurement across eight Assays, taken at 13 different times.  This can be pasted right into Step 2.</p>"],

    ["37.png",
     "<p>Here's a set of 14 measurements taken for six different materials, all as part of one Assay.  This works as well.</p>"],

    ["38.png",
     "<p>And here's a set of five different types of metadata, and values for each, across six different Assays.</p>"],

    ["39.png",
     "<p>Keep in mind that you don't have to import - or define - all your measurement data at once.</p><p>You can easily paste in, or create, a chunk of data with empty slots for measurements in it, like this one.  The EDD will create vacant slots at the proper timestamps, filling out the table.</p>"],

    ["40.png",
     "<p>Remember that back on the Study page there's that column for \"Measuring Times\"?  That shows at a glance what slots you've created for placing measurements in.  If you make a slot but don't put in a value, the slot shows up as orange in this column.  That way you can keep track of how far along you are in your data gathering.</p>"],

    ["41.png",
     "<p>A data set with blank spots will create a graph with gaps in it.  As you fill the data out over time, the graphs will slowly fill out as well.</p>"],

    ["42.png",
     "<p>The EDD has an administrator section, where you make alterations and additions to the different data types used throughout the site.  As you place your results in the EDD, you will probably have to go in here every now and then to add a new Feed, Strain, or metadata type.</p><p>Carbon Sources and Strains are special data types that are assigned to Lines.  Metadata types can be added for Lines, or for Protocols, allowing you to carry along all the incidental non-measurement data that goes with each experiment.</p><p>Every now and then you may also need to go in here and add a new Protocol, for some sweet new measurement process you've created to get more valuable data.</p><p>Let's take a quick glance at these data type admin pages, so you know what to expect.</p>"],

    ["43.png",
     "<p>This is the Carbon Sources page.  Depending on the kind of work you do, a Study may have one Feed that's the same across all your Lines, or a whole bunch of Carbon Sources with slight variations, assigned to groups of Lines.</p>"],

    ["44.png",
     "<p>This is the Strains page.  Again, you may only be working with one Strain, or you may be working with five or six, each a slight variation.  This page is where you define those Strains, and link them with the Registry components that you used to assemble them.</p>"],

    ["45.png",
     "<p>This is the Protocols page.  We've already got a list of common Protocols and a few variations, but we're sure to add more.  Each Protocol you create can optionally be set as a \"variant\" of a pre-existing Protocol, which can be a convenient piece of extra information for organizing things.</p>"],

    ["46.png",
     "<p>Each Protocol can be edited, allowing you to choose what measurement types and metadata types are relevant for that Protocol.  This affects the selections you see in pulldown menus when importing data for that Protocol.</p>"],

    ["47.png",
     "<p>... And of course you need a place to define the new measurement types that Protocols will contain ...</p>"],

    ["48.png",
     "<p>... And the metadata types, for Lines and for Protocols.</p>"],

    ["49.png",
     "<p>We have now covered all the major sections of the EDD.</p><p>If you need further guidance, be sure to check out the \"help\" links in the corner of each page.  A triangle mark next to the link means that there is a custom help section for that page, and otherwise the link takes you to a general help section.</p><p>Also, if you need more hands-on help, <a href='mailto:gwbirkel@lbl.gov'>contact me</a>, and we can set up some quick training time.</p><p>I hope you enjoy using the site!</p>"]
